RESETTING YOUR DATABASE
    1. Navigate to your docker panel. 
    2. Go to the Volumes tab on the left. 
    3. If battleship_postgres_data exists, make sure it is not running than 
       click on the 3 dots under the ACTION header and then press delete.

POPULATING THE DATABASE
    1. run docker-compose up -d --build  
    2. run docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate 
    3. At this point you should be able to navigate to localhost:8000/admin and see the login page.
    4. In the highest level battleship folder: run docker-compose exec web python manage.py loaddata populateData 
    5. Now the database should be populated with the base data that I created.

CREATING A SUPERUSER FOR DJANGO ADMIN (localhost:8000/admin) 
    Whenever working with a Django project if you want to have full permissions within Django Admin and be able to view your data, you 
    must create a Django Admin user. 
    1. run docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
    2. Follow the instructions to create your user. 
    3. Once your user has been created, you can update populateData.json so that 
       everytime we change the prepopulated database you don't have to recreate your superuser. Instructions follow.

UPDATING THE populateData.json
    1. run docker-compose exec web python manage.py dumpdata > populateData.json
    2. Make sure the json file has updated and is in the location you wanted.
